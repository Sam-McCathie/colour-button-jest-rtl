Notes:

TDD -> Test Driven Development (red -> green testing)

1. Write "shell" function
2. Write tests
3. Tests fail
4. Write code
5. Tests pass

What does React Testing Library Do?

- Creates virtual DOM for testing
  - and utilities for interacting with DOM
- Allows testing without a browser

Test types:
Unit tests -> Test one unit of code in isolation.
Integration tests -> How multiple units work together.
Functional tests -> Test a particular function of software.
Acceptance/ End-to-end (E2E) Tests -> Use actual browser and server (Cypress, Selenium)

Unit test a function if..

- Complex logic difficult to test via functional tests.
- Too many edge cases.
